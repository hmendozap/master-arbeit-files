Small repository of collection from various files used to write my thesis

+ **autosk_dev_test**: Where I load feed forward nn components to try on autosk-learn
+ **parameters_curves**: Where I fitted results from the 13 datasets to visualize hyperparameter behaviour
+ **plotting_param_distros**: Where I plotted the distributions of different parameters based on
different solver types or preprocessing methods
